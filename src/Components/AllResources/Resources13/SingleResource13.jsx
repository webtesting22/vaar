                                <p>In summary, both REITs and Discreit provide valuable opportunities for investors to access real estate investments with varying degrees of control, liquidity, and investment horizon. The choice between the two would depend on an investor's preferences, risk tolerance, and investment objectives. REITs may be suitable for those seeking a more liquid and diversified approach, while Discreit offers a more hands-on, direct ownership experience in specific real estate assets.</p>
